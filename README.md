Ecstatic-Wordpress
==================

Add your content into Wordpress, setup your page structure and once you're done, deploy a completely static version of your site which can be copied and viewed anywhere. This plugin is built out of need for a site that will rarely change and need to be handed over to a client.

## Limitations

Due to the dynamic nature of some components of Wordpress, once you deploy a site, some things will no longer work. This means comments will no longer work and you will need to explore alternatives like Disqus. Any dynamic forms that use code within Wordpress or a theme will also not work.
